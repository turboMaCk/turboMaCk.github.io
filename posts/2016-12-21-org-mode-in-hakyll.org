As an [[https://gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] user I'm really glad that I can benefit from full power of [[http://pandoc.org][Pandoc]] thanks to [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]] while creating this site.
One of the Emacs' beloved mode - [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] is supported by Pandoc therefore you can use it as markup language in Hakyll.
Org-mode is really powerful. There is only problem with it - it's almost exclusive for Emacs environment.
[[https://gist.github.com/kinjo/509761][Github]] maybe supports org preview but true power of org comes from editing experience in Emacs.
Because Org is so exclusive to Emacs (written in E-Lisp) it's hardly default markup even for many Emacs users simply
because many of them has to to support all kinds of users not just ones who happen to use Emacs and org. Markdown is de-facto standard these days.
This is for example why I'm personally also writing markdown daily. However this is quite different when it comes
to project maintained only by one person - you. Org mode is simply so much better for taking notes, creating to-dos and much more
that it become one of the most successful Emacs extension. Especially when it comes to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] which is what I mostly trying to do
on this blog and more generally [[http://reproducibleresearch.net][reproducible research]] which is movement I'm pretty big fan of.
I'm also actively looking for interesting ideas and tools since I've discovered [[https://jupyter.org][Jubyter notebooks]] about a year ago.

To be honest since I'm mostly working on documents maintain by group of people (mostly colleagues) I'm not really an expert on org-mode.
Anyway I was working on new blog post recently where I would really appreciate some of Org's features.
This is why I've recently added org support to this site willing to test Pandoc support.
I've also decided to keep this document public on this site as a kind of reference which might be helpful to some folks.

Actually this is the end of post itself. Everything below is just to test how Pandoc handles org files.

* This is H1

There is paragraph under h1

** H2

*** H3

* Some basic test

This is *bold*, /italic/, =code=, ~verbatim~ and +strike+ text.

- However */bold and italic/* doesn't play well when used together like in markdown.

  - child
    - deep

** Other style

* Check List [1/3] [33%]
- [ ] Item
- [ ] Item
- [X] Checked item

Heading and has special class however =<ul>= and =<li>= are plain.

* Task List

** TODO some to-do

** DONE done to-do

Items are added with special class.

* Tables

| number | description        |
|--------+--------------------|
|      1 | looooong long name |
|      5 | name               |

=<tr>= has =even= and =odd= classes.

* Source Code

*Emacs Lisp:*

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun negate (x)
    "Negate the value of x."
    (- x))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output
(print
    (negate 10))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:
: -10

There are interesting classes like =sourceCode= and =example=.
Also there html5 attributes prefixed with =rundoc-=.

*Haskell:*

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results output
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
#+END_SRC

* LaTeX

- *Characters:* \alpha \beta \rightarrow \uparrow \or \and \implies \pi \infty
- *Inline Math:* $f(x) = x^2$
- *More complex:* $\frac{x^2}{2}$

LaTeX characters are wrapped in ~<em>~ and Math inside ~<span class="math inline">~.

** \mathscr{Hello!}

\begin{align*}
  8 * 3 &= 8 + 8 \\
        &= 24
\end{align*}

*NOTE:* /There is standard LaTeX embeded above which is skipped during compilation to HTML./

*This is using* [[MathJax][https://www.mathjax.org/]]

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$
