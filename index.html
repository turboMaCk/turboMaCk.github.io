    <h2>Hello There!</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Marek Fajkus. I was born in 1990 in Brno, Czech Republic.<br>
      I work as a software engineering contractor and occasionally write about my experience on this blog.
      My primary focus is on web development and functional programming even though I enjoy hacking on any type of stuff
      when ever I can.<br>
      I'm also big fan of music and "post-punk" alternative genres like in particular.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>I'm currently looking for new opportunities.</strong></br>
